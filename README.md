Microservices & CI/CD Pipeline on AWS
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the migration of a monolithic web application to a microservices architecture using AWS cloud services. The solution implements a complete CI/CD pipeline for automated blue/green deployments.

What This Lab Accomplished
Transformed a monolithic coffee supplier application into containerized microservices

Built two independent microservices (Customer and Employee services)

Implemented full CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy

Configured blue/green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates

Set up load balancing with AWS Application Load Balancer

Containerized applications using Docker and Amazon ECR

Orchestrated services using Amazon ECS

Automated deployments triggered by code changes

Key AWS Services Used
AWS Cloud9 (Development Environment)

Amazon ECS (Container Orchestration)

Amazon ECR (Container Registry)

Application Load Balancer

AWS CodePipeline (CI/CD)

AWS CodeDeploy (Blue/Green Deployment)

AWS CodeCommit (Source Control)

Amazon RDS (Database)

Architecture Highlights
Microservices Architecture: Split monolithic app into independent services

CI/CD Automation: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

Blue/Green Deployment: Risk-free production deployments

Containerization: Docker-based portable application packaging

Scalable Infrastructure: Auto-scaling and load balancing capabilities

Result
Successfully created a modern, cloud-native application architecture that is scalable, maintainable, and features automated deployment processes—replacing the original monolithic application with reliability and performance issues.

Screenshots demonstrate the step-by-step implementation and final architecture.
